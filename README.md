This bot is running off of DiscordJS V14. 
Its modular, and this bot contains the skeleton for a basic Discord bot, as well as an API call built into it. This is the "gumroad.js" folder.
Fields that require custom numbers such as tokens, IDs, etc have been replaced with a string saying "Your ___ here".
A custom command is also included, so it is simple to see how to replicate this and make your own commands. Note you have to manually push commands to Discord.
